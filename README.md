Sierpinski Triangle

`Sierpinski Triangle` The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal, a geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole. It's named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński who documented it in 1915, although its roots can be traced back to the 13th-century work of Italian mathematician Fibonacci.

The Sierpinski Triangle is a mathematical and geometric marvel that continues to be a subject of study in mathematics and computer science because of its intriguing recursive nature. It's created by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively removing smaller equilateral triangles from it.

This project displays an animated version of the Sierpinski Triangle, starting with a single equilateral triangle and progressively adding smaller triangles over a duration of 2 seconds. The animation showcases the fascinating depth and complexity that this simple recursive process can generate.  It's built with [SoldJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).
